# BetterJoy Win Max v1.0 (based off source code from BetterJoy v6.4Î±)

This version of BetterJoy is intended primarily for use with a GPD Win Max internal gamepad and a Left Joycon to hijack the Rumble and gyro features from it for use on the GPD Win Max handheld computer.

Allows the GPD Win Max (or any Xinput controller in the first controller slot) to merge with a JoyCon or Pro Controller for rumble and gyro use.
It also allows using the gyro to control your mouse and remap the special buttons (SL, SR, Capture) to key bindings of your choice.

A massive thanks goes out to [rajkosto](https://github.com/rajkosto/) for putting up with 17 emails and replying very quickly to my silly queries. The UDP server is also mostly taken from his [ScpToolkit](https://github.com/rajkosto/ScpToolkit) repo.

Also I am very grateful to [mfosse](https://github.com/mfosse/JoyCon-Driver) for pointing me in the right direction and to [Looking-Glass](https://github.com/Looking-Glass/JoyconLib) without whom I would not be able to figure anything out. (being honest here - the joycon code is his)

Many thanks to [nefarius](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus) for his ViGEm project! Apologies and appreciation go out to [epigramx](https://github.com/epigramx), creator of *WiimoteHook*, for giving me the driver idea and for letting me keep using his installation batch script even though I took it without permission. Thanks go out to [MTCKC](https://github.com/MTCKC/ProconXInput) for inspiration and batch files.

A last thanks goes out to [dekuNukem](https://github.com/dekuNukem/Nintendo_Switch_Reverse_Engineering) for his documentation, especially on the SPI calibration data and the IMU sensor notes!
